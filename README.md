# time-until-next-year
This is pretty much a timer that shows you how many days, minutes, hours, and seconds till the next year. When it is January 1 of the next year, it will say Happy New Year! And stop counting unless you decide to re-run it and start a timer for the year for that. It imports datetime and time modules to calculate it.
